# achieve *moist*™

*I love water! It tastes good and I need it to live.*

**Currently, this project is not functional at all.**

Moist is a hydration tracker app created for a school project. Personally, I
don't think I would use this, but if you would, that's fine, I guess. This is
not exactly the best thing to use long-term since it uses `localStorage` which
has a somewhat small limit but I'll try to store information as efficiently as
possible! It's all static files, so you should be able to just downlaod it,
extract the .ZIP, and open it in your browser. However, if you want to host it
on a server for several users, the `announcements.js` file is explicitly meant
for you to put announcements and stuff in, just to make things a bit more
personal! Am I being too sentimental? I think it's the music I'm listening to.
